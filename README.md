# Pistachio Text to Speech
My python text to speech project

<br>

It works by scanning a word backwards for specific letter combinations.

For example: "saturated"

It starts with 8 characters, checking if `aturated.mp3` exists. It doesn't, next it tries `turated.mp3`, `urated.mp3`, `rated.mp3` and finally `ated.mp3` does exist. It skips back 4 characters to get rid of ated and checks for `satur.mp3`, `atur.mp3` etc. and finds `ur.mp3`. It skips back another 2 characters and finds `sat.mp3` first try, ending up with `['sat.mp3', 'ur.mp3', 'ated.mp3']`

Requirements:
 - python3
 - ffmpeg
 - pydub

options:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Default is tts-output.mp3 in the running directory
  -v VOLUME, --volume VOLUME
                        Sets output volume, default is 2.0
  --decompress          Decompress recordings to raw uncompressed wavs instead of mp3s. This takes up a bit more storage but makes generation of long
                        texts multiple times faster. Use this arguement every time you want to use uncompressed training data, otherwise it will default to
                        compressed.
  --del-uncompressed    Delete uncompressed training data generated by --decompress to save space.
  --debug               Long debug output
```

Example usage:
`python3 tts.py --decompress -i "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." `

It's reccomended that you always use `--decompress`, it only takes an extra 16 megabytes (instead of 3) for the recordings, and makes it many times faster. It takes a while to decompress the first time but it only does it once as long as you don't use `--del-uncompressed`.
